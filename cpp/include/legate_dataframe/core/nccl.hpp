 * @brief Get the NCCL task handle
 *
 * This assumes that the calling task was created with a NCCL communicator,
 * see `legate::AutoTask::add_communicator()`.
 *
 * Notice, if a task launch ends up emitting only a single point task, that task will
 * not get passed a communicator, even if one was requested at task launching time.
 * In this case, a `std::out_of_range` exception is thrown.
 *
 * @param ctx The context of the calling task
 * @param idx The index of the NCCL communicator i.e. the order it was added to the task.
 * @return The NCCL communicator
 * @throw  std::out_of_range if @p idx is an invalid index.
