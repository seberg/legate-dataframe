/**
 * @brief Perform a groupby and aggregation in a single operation.
 *
 * @param table The table to group and aggregate.
 * @param keys The names of the columns whose rows act as the groupby keys.
 * @param column_aggregations A vector of column aggregations to perform. Each column aggregation
 * produces a column in the output table by performing an aggregation-kind on a column in `table`.
 * It consist of a tuple: `(<input-column-name>, <aggregation-kind>, <output-column-name>)`. E.g.
 * `("x", "sum", "sum-of-x")` will produce a column named "sum-of-x" in the output table, which, for
 * each groupby key, has a row that contains the sum of the values in the column "x". Multiple
 * column aggregations can share the same input column but all output columns must be unique and not
 * conflict with the name of the key columns.
 * @return A new logical table that contains the key columns and the aggregated columns using the
 * output column names and order specified in `column_aggregations`.
