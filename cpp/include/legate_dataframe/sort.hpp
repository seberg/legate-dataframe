/**
 * @brief Sort a logical table.
 *
 * Reorder the logical table so that the keys columns are sorted lexicographic
 * based on their column_order and null_precedence. The GPU and CPU backends may not sort NaN values
 * exactly the same way (e.g. according to null_precendence or by treating them as large floating
 * point numbers) - it is recommended to instead use nulls instead of NaNs to get a consistent
 * behaviour between CPU/GPU launches.
 *
 * @param tbl The table to sort
 * @param keys The column names to sort by.
 * @param sort_ascending Whether to sort ascending or descending for each key.
 * @param nulls_at_end Whether nulls are placed at the begging or end (regardless of ascending or
 * descending sort).
 * @return The sorted LogicalTable
