/**
 * @brief Read csv files into a LogicalTable
 *
 * Files are currently read into N partitions where N is the number of GPU workers used.
 * The partitions are split by row, meaning that each reads approximately the
 * same number of rows (possibly over multiple files).
 * If the number of rows does not split evenly, the first partitions will
 * contain one additional row.
 *
 * Note that file order is currently glob/string sorted.
 *
 * TODO: We should replace some/all params with cudf::io::csv_reader_options eventually.
 *       As if writing, this would be better with pylibcudf 25.02 which cannot be quite used.
 *
 * @param glob_string The glob string to specify the csv files. All glob matches must be valid
 * csv files and have the same layout. See <https://linux.die.net/man/7/glob>.
 * @param dtypes The cudf type for each column (must match usecols).
 * @param na_filter Whether to detect missing values, set to false to improve performance.
 * @param delimiter The field delimiter.
 * @param names The column names to read from the file, if not passed reads all columns.
 * @param usecols Column index in file.  If given, assumes the file includes no header.
 * passing `usecols_idx` without names is not supported.
 * @return The read LogicalTable.
